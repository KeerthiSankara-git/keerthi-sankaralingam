## 🧠 About Me

## 🧠 About Me

I’m a passionate and detail-oriented Software Engineer currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I bring 3+ years of industry experience from Wipro Limited, where I worked across the full stack to build user-focused, enterprise-grade web applications.

I enjoy solving real-world challenges through clean code, intuitive interfaces, and scalable architectures. My interests lie at the intersection of frontend elegance and backend efficiency, and I take pride in writing code that's as maintainable as it is functional.

When I’m not coding, I love exploring emerging technologies, learning about system design, and building side projects that challenge me to grow outside the classroom.
